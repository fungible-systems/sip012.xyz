        The current Clarity cost limits were set very conservatively in Stacks 2.0: blocks with
        contract-calls frequently meet one or more of these limits, which negatively affects
        transaction throughput. This SIP proposes an update to these cost-limits via a network
        upgrade and further, that the network upgrade be executed at a block height chosen by an
        off-chain process described in this SIP.
